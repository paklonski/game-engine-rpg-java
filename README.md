-------------------------------------

**ABOUT THE GAME**     

The game world includes the main character, soldiers, zombies, river, chests, various types of axes, keys, money for bribing soldiers and so on.         

The game consists of one game level. The user selects the game mode: new game or last saved one. Then there is the possibility of choosing the main character, on behalf of whom the game will take place. Next, the game begins.    

The main character can move, collect items and use them. The main goal is to go through all the rooms of the playing field to reach the final point - the castle.        

If the hero on the way to the castle loses his health due to meeting the enemies, the game ends with a loss, if the castle is reached - the game ends with success and can theoretically be continued with subsequent game levels.      

Game field control keys: 

**W** - to move up      
**A** - to move left       
**S** - to move down         
**D** - to move right           
**LEFT** - to move the selection frame on the items bar to the left
